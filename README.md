# Advent Of Code

In 2022 I had the brilliant idea to participate in the code of advent. My
weapon of choice was Rust. I have to admit, I learned a lot about Rust and I
really liked it. It is incredibly fast, easy to setup and has a steep learning
curve. It has a very strict typing, but once you get the concept of borrowing,
it gets easier.

After hardly programming in rust in 2023, I started with aoc 2023 and found myself
fighting with correcting types again. I had the solutions written down, but making
it compile and run took sometimes over an hour.

And then I found a repo of a colleague of mine, using typescript and bun. I heard
about bun, but never used it. It is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit
designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible
package manager.

Using typescript at work and wanting to get better at it, plus experimenting with
bun... the choice was made to switch after a few challenges to typescript.

## Getting started

First you have to install [bun](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
bun day --year 2023 --day 01
```
